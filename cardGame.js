/* 
Overview 

Create a JS file that uses classes to create an object representing a deck of cards. Then create a simple console version of the card game 'War'

Steps: 

1. Create a Deck class 


2. Create a method on the Deck class that dynamically generates each card object
example card object: {suit: "hearts", value: 2}

a card's value corresponds to the number/face card's rank

ace = 1
cards 2-10 = their number value 
jacks = 11 
queens = 12 
kings = 13 

3. card objects can be held inside an array 

4. create a method to select a random card object 

5. create a function that runs the random card method on each deck, and compares the values of the 2 random cards

6. console log both card objects, and a message declaring which one has the higher value
